### 程艺明

I graduated from Northeast Forestry University with a bachelor's degree. I can use modeling software such as proe,Rhino and alias, but I lack programming ability. I like reading, drawing and singing. I hope to improve my software and programming ability and make progress in teamwork through the course of design engineering.
